pciod.c - a daemon providing an ach interface to power cube modules
pciod_ssm - the somatic message management library for motor state and command messages
pciod_commander - a shell tool for talking to the can network through pciod

See pciod_ssm.h for an overview of how to use this library

Currently pciod is set up for only 2 channels: one for commands and another for states.
The main loop blocks while waiting for commands, and only updates when the acknowldgement
is received.

//TODO: implement a timeout on the wait call, and when it's up just poll the devices
for their status and update the state channel

//TODO: implement the update request function (need to know what CAN message to use, and
add this to the motor_command message enum)

./pciod -v -b 0 -m 4 -m 5 -m 6 -m 7 -b 1 -m 8 -m 9 -m 10
