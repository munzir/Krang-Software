This is a collection of stuff for publishing states from imu-type devices on ach channels.
For basic library calls to read these devices, see ssdmu.c/h. This library also includes special functionality for Krang, such as an easy calculating of the pitch.

The daemon return a double vector with the following meanings:

[0] Linear acceleration along x-axis as g
[1] Linear acceleration along y-axis as g
[2] Linear acceleration along z-axis as g
[3] Rotation about x-axis as rads/sec
[4] Rotation about y-axis as rads/sec
[5] Rotation about z-axis as rads/sec

Files:
ssdmu.c/h - basic library for the imu
imud.c - the imu publisher
imu_listen_and_print.c - example program for how to listen to a imu channel and unpack it

Usage:

$ ./imud -C (the first time)
-or-
$ ./imud (if the channel already exists)

$ ./imu_listen_and_print --channel="imu-data"
