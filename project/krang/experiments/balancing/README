The purpose of this project is to perform experiments on balancing of Krang. It is intended to pick up
from krang-balance-hack, prune it to the minimum required code needed to balance krang and to store the 
values of the states of the systen (imu pos, imu vel, wheel pos and wheel vel) and control input (motor
current) for reporting, and then use this platform to perform different experiments:

1) Balancing Krang with just the base and spine and do
	a) velocity control
	b) trajectory based control (figure 8)
3) Balancing Krang with a weight placed on spine and repeat the above two experiments
4) Place back the arms and repeat the above experiments
5) Allow the arms/waist to move while doing the trajectory control
