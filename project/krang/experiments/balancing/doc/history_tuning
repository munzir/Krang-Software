465.0, 90.0, 3.0, 13.0, 15.0, 15.0; 
300.0, 60.0, 3.0, 13.0, 15.0, 15.0;	// decrease passion - more relaxed result - slower oscillations
475.0, 112.0, 3.0, 13.0, 15.0, 15.0;	// change inertia in matlab from 10 to 15, more passion than 1
436.0, 60.0, 1.0, 7.0, 15.0, 15.0;	// change inertia in matlab from 10 to 5, Q changed to identity from Q(3-4,3-4) = 10, much less passionate but still unstable
300.0, 60.0, 3.0, 10.0, 15.0, 15.0;	// trying the gains from the old krang controller, first it was not as good, maybe a bit better than 6 (can's), second time it was quite good

Started playing around 300, 60, 3, 10
1- Going up to kp_th=340, we saw a consistent increase in shakes but still stable
2- Observed that if we don't wait for imu to settle with kalman, it does not work. Just fixed it but didn't help!

Trying 275, 55, 3, 10: It was bad once, then it was good twice.

An interpretation of the system is just a circular spring. Holding it and pulling away from the 0, and feeling the force on the hand while keeping track of the balancing angle, should give us an expectation of what we have the spring strength to be. With this in mind, basing off on our random feelings, we decided to increase Kp_TH to 300.0. 

We are at 300, 55 now. With Munzir's crazy shaking, we need to stabilize the system by hand. As we decrease from 55 to 40, we have seen disturbance rejection to such shaking gets better and system stabilizes by itself within 3-4 seconds.

35 seems to be better (can and munzir) for disturbance but not so much for settling time. 40 seems better.

---------------------------- TORSO MODULE ADDITION ----------------------------------

With 300, 40, we saw a lot of overshoot and the spring was too tough. So, we decreased to 260, 40.

Increasing kd helps with overshoots but shakes are observed.

------------------- ARMS FORWARD WITH STANDING UP 6 deg ------------

250 45/50 lead to shaking after stand up. 250 38 worked. 

However, now we see a moving forward due to low x gains, the robot moves forward when standing up. 
We increased the gains from (3,10) to (7,10) which decreased the overshoot but now there is 
shaking.

11 stopped to oscillations in x direction and half a foot motion is acceptable.

CHanging from (7,9) to (15,15) did not seem affect the dx in beginning too much (2 cm).

Observed that Kp and Kd (?) for x should be negative. -25 kp with balancing off seems semi 
sufficient to control when kd is 0.0.

We ended up using 250 38 4 10 3 7 for the video 07/14th, time 11 am.

------------------------------------- POSITION TUNING -------------------------------------

The waist is low at 162 degrees. We start off with 250 38 4 10 3 7. Both wheel pressures are at 35 
psi.

Oscillations in the position were minimized ny increasing the gain for xdot. At Kp, Kd = 4, 10 we 
get some oscilaations. We increased Kd to 19 to minimize the oscillations.  

The current gains are 250 38 4 10 2 10 0.2 0.4. And we are taking a video (July 16, 2013). And the
position control at this waist height looks acceptable.
